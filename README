MakeWav
=======

OVERVIEW

This is a program that writes a .wav file (following the RIFF specification)
and allows you to fill the file with audio data created through wavetable
synthesis.  After it is created, the file should be playable by any standard
audio player (i.e. iTunes).


CURRENT CAPABILITIES

The program first provides the user with options for timbre, number of
channels, sample rate, and bit-depth, after which the user is prompted to write
a melody.  The program then writes a .wav file that plays this melody.
