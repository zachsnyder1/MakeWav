OVERVIEW

This is a program that writes a .wav file (following the RIFF specification)
and allows you to fill the file with audio data created through wavetable
synthesis.  After it is created, the file should be playable by any standard
audio player (i.e. iTunes).


CURRENT CAPABILITIES

Right now the program writes a file named 'sine.wav' that plays a sine wave
with a frequency of 100 Hz for 10 seconds.  It does not take any user input,
but I will be expanding the funtionality of the program soon.

NOTE:  The first half second or so of the file contains distortion,
       which is undesirable and puzzling, but probably not damaging
       to speakers.  I'll try to fix this.
