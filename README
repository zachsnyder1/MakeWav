MakeWav
=======

OVERVIEW

This is a program that writes a .wav file (following the RIFF specification)
and allows you to fill the file with audio data created through wavetable
synthesis.  After it is created, the file should be playable by any standard
audio player (e.g. iTunes).

The program's user interface is split into three sections:

 1) Initialization => User is prompted to set the .wav file parameters.
 2) Custom Timbre Synthesis => User is prompted to create a custom
    ...(optional)              waveform for use in waveteble synthesis.
 3) Melody Creation => User is prompted to create the melody that will
                       be written into the .wav file.


INITIALIZATION

To write a .wav file, certain parameters need to be set.  The user is prompted
with options for each parameter.  (No options are given for 'filename', because
there would be an infinite number.)

   WAV FILE PARAMETERS:
   -------------------
    'timbre' => The waveform that is used for wavetable synthesis.
    'filename' => The name of the WAV file that will be created.  This
                  MUST end in the '.wav' file extension.
    'number of channels' => One channel creates a mono file.  Two channels
                            creates a stereo file.  These are functionally
                            equivalent if both channels contain the same info,
                            but the stereo file will be twice as large.
    'sample rate' => The number of samples per second of audio.  A higher
                     sampe rate translates to a greater available bandwidth
                     for the audio signal.  44100 Hz is recommended.
    'bit-depth => The number of bits in each audio sample.  Higher bit-depth
                  means more precise amplitude values, assuming ideal DAC
                  performance.

     x   --->  Abort program


CUSTOM TIMBRE SYNTHESIS (optional; adapted from Jamboard project)

The 'synthesize custom timbre' function allows you to synthesize a new sound by
setting the relative amplitude for each harmonic, up to the 31st harmonic.
Relative amplitudes are values between 0 and 100.  Enter a value for each
harmonic as you are promted.  A value of 0 means the harmonic is not included
in the sound.  When you have entered a value for the highest harmonic that you
want to include, enter 's' (without quotations), and hit RETURN, to synthesize
the sound.

   LOCAL COMMANDS:
   --------------
     z   --->  Print custom synthesis info
     s   --->  Synthesize waveform
     x   --->  Abort program


MELODY CREATION

The user is prompted to create a melody by entering each successive note and
its duration.  Note values are the note letter (lower case), optionally
followed by either '#' for sharp or 'b' for flat.  When a note letter is
entered, the pitch that will be written depends on what the 'current octave'
is.  Each octave ranges from A to G#.  The program always starts in OCTAVE = 3,
but the '+' and '-' commands increment and decrement the octave.  Here's an
example of entering notes into the melody:

  Note: a#                <-------- Writes an A-sharp in the current octave...
   Its duration: 1/8      <-------- ...for an 'eighth note' duration.
  Note: cb                <-------- Writes a C-flat in the current octave...
   Its duration: 1        <-------- ...for a 'whole note' duration

   LOCAL COMMANDS:
   --------------
     +   --->  Go up an octave
     -   --->  Go down an octave
     w   --->  Write the file
     z   --->  Print melody creation info
     x   --->  Abort program
