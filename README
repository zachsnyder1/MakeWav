OVERVIEW

This is a program that writes a .wav file (following the RIFF specification)
and allows you to fill the file with audio data created through wavetable
synthesis.  After it is created, the file should be playable by any standard
audio player (i.e. iTunes).


CURRENT CAPABILITIES

Right now the program provides the user with options for timbre, number of
channels, sample rate, and bit-depth, and then writes a sound that plays at
~110 Hz for 10 seconds based on those parameters.  It does not allow the user
to set note duration or pitch, but I will be adding those capabilities soon.

NOTE:  The first half second or so of the file contains distortion,
       which is undesirable and puzzling.  I'm trying to fix this.
